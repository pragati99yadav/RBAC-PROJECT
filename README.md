RBAC-PROJECT
Description
The RBAC-PROJECT is a Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system that helps manage access to resources based on the roles of users within an organization. This project allows administrators to define roles, assign permissions to those roles, and associate users with the roles to control their access to different parts of the system.

Features
Role-based permissions for accessing resources
User authentication and authorization
Admin role management
Dynamic assignment of roles to users
Easy configuration for various levels of access control
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/Pragati99Yadav/RBAC-PROJECT.git
Navigate into the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd RBAC-PROJECT
Install dependencies (assuming the project uses Node.js):

bash
Copy code
npm install
Usage
After installing dependencies, you can start the server:

bash
Copy code
npm start
The application will run on http://localhost:3000 (or another port depending on the configuration).

To manage users and roles:

Admins can add, modify, and delete users.
Roles can be defined and linked to users for different access levels.
Permissions can be granted to specific roles, which will then be inherited by the users.
Technologies Used
Node.js for backend server
Express for building RESTful APIs
MongoDB for database management (or another database system)
JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for user authentication and authorization
Mongoose (if using MongoDB) for object data modeling (ODM)
Project Structure
graphql
